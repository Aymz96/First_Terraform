### What is Terraform?
- Terraform is an Orchestration tool which part of the infrastructure as code.

- In comparison to Chef and packer where these are referred to more of a configuration management side and create immutable AMI's

- Terraform sits on the Orchestration side. This includes the creation of networks and complex systems to deploy AMI's

- An AMI is a blue print of an instance.
  - The operating system
  - Data and storage
  - All the packages and exact state of a machine when AMI was created.

### Commands

```python
terraform init
```
- The terraform init command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times.

```python
terraform plan
```

- The terraform plan command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files.

```python
terraform apply
```

- The terraform apply command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan.

### Changing variable names in terminal
- Dynamically changing variables (save time if needed)

```python
terraform plan -var 'name=any new name'
terraform plan -var 'ami_id= new ami id'
