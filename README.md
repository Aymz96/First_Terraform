# Terraform Javascript App  :computer: :cd:

This repository has been designed to orchestrate a VPC in AWS and deploy a Javascript app in an EC2 machine using AMI with Terraform

- The project consists of a main.tf file which runs the main code for the terraform and variables.tf file which is used to create variables and call them in the main.tf file.

- In the NodeSampleApp_tf repo theres a packer.json file which has been used to develop an AMI in order to launch the AWS instance.

###### Notice:
If you haven't already, please go to the NodeSampleApp_tf repository follow the steps before continuing to Terraform or clone the repo from here: `git clone git@github.com:Aymz96/NodeSampleApp_tf.git`

### Prerequisites
- In order to run the NodeSampleApp_tf on the EC2 cloud you must ensure you have the following below:

```CSS
- AMI
- AWS Cli
- Terraform
- AWS Credentials
- Pem key
- Git
- IPv4 Public IP
- Atom
```

### What is Terraform?
- Terraform is an Orchestration tool which part of the infrastructure as code.

- In comparison to Chef and packer where these are referred to more of a configuration management side and create immutable AMI's.

- Terraform sits on the Orchestration side. This includes the creation of networks and complex systems to deploy AMI's.

- An AMI is a blue print of an instance.
  - The operating system
  - Data and storage
  - All the packages and exact state of a machine when AMI was created.

### Setup Terraform to run the app
- The main.tf and variables.tf needs to be configured to create an EC2 using an AMI and VPC which adds security to the cloud instance, as done in this repository.

- Once this has been done, `cd` into the TerraformJavascript_App  directory and run the command below:
```python
terraform plan
```
- The terraform plan command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files.

- If `terraform plan` is successful run the next command below:
```python
terraform apply
```
- The terraform apply command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan. In this case it will create a new EC2 machine using the AMI-ID which has been coded into the variables.tf file.

- The Terminal will continue to run in this case after it has successfully created the EC2 as the app will be listening to port 3000.
```python
aws_instance.app_instance: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
```
### Testing App in the cloud
- Now you must test if the App is running. Open a new web browser and enter your EC2 `IPv4 Public IP`. The App will display. Then enter `IPv4 Public IP/fibonacci/5` to view the fibonacci generator; Success.
